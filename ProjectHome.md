XMPPWebChat is a Web Application which enables chat in a webpage and is capable to connect with any standard XMPP chat servers and enable chat related features. Currently it can be used to connect Gtalk and Facebook chat which are widely used chat servers.

This Application is being moved to Github any future bug fixes or changes will be updated in this [Github repository ](https://github.com/udayg/xmppwebchat)

Also since Downloads feature is depreciated by google we uploaded the compiled 1.3 version in [XMPPWebChat-1.3.war](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwHJeilltye8SmJHX1h5U3RoMUU/edit?usp=sharing)
